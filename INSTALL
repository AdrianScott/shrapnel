Coro runs on FreeBSD, Linux and MacOS X on i386 and amd64 architectures.

In order to build, it requires:
- cython (/usr/ports/lang/cython on FreeBSD or your package manager of choice on linux).
- aplib from the IronPort github area at the same base directory as shrapnel

Since aplib is both a build and runtime requirement, make sure that is
installed first.

Then build and install shrapnel:

$ python setup.py build
# python setup.py install
