Coro runs on FreeBSD 4/5 on either x86/x86_64 (aka amd64).
It could probably be run on Linux or other x86 unix flavors if a
version of kqueue_poller() was written for select/poll/etc...,
depending on the platform.

Currently, coro requires a few small changes to both Python and
Pyrex to support the 'long long' 64-bit data type.  The scheduler
heavily uses 64-bit TSC (x86 timestamp counter) as its internal clock
mechanism, so it's important that Pyrex be able to manipulate these
efficiently.

python.patch is a patch against Python-2.4a3
pyrex.patch is a patch against Pyrex-0.9.3

Once the patches have been applied, you should be able to:

$ python setup.py build install
