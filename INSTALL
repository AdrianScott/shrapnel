Coro runs on FreeBSD and linux on i386 and amd64 architectures.

It requires cython to build (/usr/ports/lang/cython on FreeBSD or your
package manager of choice on linux).

$ python setup.py build
# python setup.py install

Once installed it requires aplib, also in the IronPort github area, as a runtime dependency.
